I believe it will happen before the end of September. </p>\\<p><img src=\"http://images.scripting.com/archiveScriptingCom/2004/08/31/accordianGuy.gif\" width=\"81\" height=\"194\" border=\"0\" align=\"right\" hspace=\"15\" vspace=\"5\" alt=\"A picture named accordianGuy.gif\">Technically, the software is ready to go. Andre Radke, who was the last full-time maintainer of the code at UserLand, up until four years ago, when he returned to be a full-time physics grad student, did the work to get the code ready. Steve Zellers at Apple has also been participating. I see Andre and Steve as the two leaders of the project once the release has taken place. I trust both of them, I can't imagine two better people to entrust this project to. I see myself as playing an advisory role, writing scripts to test new versions, and representing Frontier as a legal entity.</p>\\<p><img src=\"http://images.scripting.com/archiveScriptingCom/2004/08/31/frontier.gif\" width=\"33\" height=\"33\" border=\"0\" align=\"left\" hspace=\"15\" vspace=\"5\" alt=\"A picture named frontier.gif\">The one remaining issue to decide is the license agreement. I guess this has always been so, but now it's the crucial decision, once it's made, the release can proceed. Here's my current thinking, after having talked with several lawyers with experience in open source software, and having read up on various approaches, this is what I've come up with. (Note I am not a lawyer, I am posting this so that lawyers can comment publicly.)</p>\\<p>1. No breakage. I want old scripts continue to run in new environments. A lot has been invested in code that runs in the Frontier environment, one of the reasons to release the kernel as source is so that those apps will run better, in more operating systems. I want to limit incentives for people to fork based on compatibility. I don't want to create a dozen semi-clones of Frontier, rather I want to incentivize people to add to the culture, add new features, fix user interface bugs, but not to break apps. </p>\\<p>2. I want it to be possible to create a commercial business from the code base. However, I want the general rule to be that if you make an improvement to the code, you must share it on equal terms. </p>\\<p>I think these two goals clearly imply a base license that's GPL-like, with an option for a more liberal license, for either a cash fee, or an agreement to remain compatible, or a combination of fee and agreement. This is a derivative of the MySQL license system.</p>\\<p>I'm looking for feedback from lawyers who have experience with open source licenses, and developers who have released code under open source licenses, and people who have used code under open source licenses. The best form of feedback is in public, on a weblog, so you can <a href=\"http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/dave/profiles/sendMail?usernum=1 referer=/2004/08/31\">send</a> a URL and I can point to it. I'm not opening a comment thread on this becuase it's sure to only attract unconstructive comments.</p>\\<p>Note that we are not trying to shake up the world, or change what anyone does, or kill anything, or necessarily even create anything. So comments that say things like \"This will never kill Apache\" or \"Python already has too much of a lead\" while quite common, always miss the point. </p>\\<p><a href=\"http://archive.scripting.com/2004/05/17#asGoodATimeAsAny\">For an idea of why</a> I'm releasing Frontier as open source, please refer to this article I wrote in May.</p>\\", "Software and Developement"], [349254, "WOKR-TV", "Halo 2 Hits The Streets", "http://www.herald-dispatch.com/2004/November/07/LFedge1.htm", "(Rochester, NY) 11/09/04 -- Workers in some Rochester-area toy and game stores worked late Monday night as fans of  quot;Halo 2 quot; lined up to buy a copy of the X-Box game that went on sale at midnight.", "Sci/Tech"], [406611, "Washington Post Business", "Adelphia's Former CFO Doesn't Think He Acted Illegally", "http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A4524-2004Nov22.html?nav=rss_business", "Adelphia's former CFO doesn't think he acted illegally", "Business"], [279816, "Reuters", "Sharapova downs Venus to reach Zurich semi-finals", "http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/hockey/aphockey_story.asp?category=2041 amp;slug=TEN Zurich", "Wimbledon champion Maria Sharapova beat former world number one Venus Williams 6-3 6-4 on Friday to reach the semi-finals of the \\$1.", "Sports"], [267882, "CNN International", "ING: Spitzer wants information", "http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3758486.stm", "Dutch-based insurer says NY attorney general probing fees paid to brokers for new business.
